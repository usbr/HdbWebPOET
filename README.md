# HdbWebPOET
This software application is currently being developed to modernize the Windows Forms [HDB POET](https://github.com/usbr/HdbPoet) desktop application with the goal of eventually replacing it as a data management solution. HDB Web POET is a web-based application used to view, query, edit, and manage data within a Reclamation Hydrologic Database (HDB). 

This application's visual pages, features, and layouts are based on the [AdminLTE](https://github.com/almasaeed2010/AdminLTE) and [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) frameworks. This application is also being developed using project code obtained via the Microsoft Developer Network for an [ASP.NET MVC Application with a Custom Layout](https://code.msdn.microsoft.com/ASPNET-MVC-Application-b4b0dc3f#content) as a reference. Work to mimic HDB POET graphical user interfaces, functionality, and as much of the source code is ongoing.
